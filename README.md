# Password Generator Starter Code

## Script.JS
In ```generatepassword()``` I ended up creating most of the code within that function

I created characters that had a list of all the alphebet and special characters in ```char```

I used ```passwordLength``` and ```password``` as the other variables within the ```for``` loop equation. 

In the ```for```loop equation the ```var randomNumber``` and the ```password``` make up the equation to get the random password generator using the different characters.
